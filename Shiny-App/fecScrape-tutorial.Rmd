## Analyzing Contributions for the 2018 Election

### Motivation

The Federal Election Comission provides open access for [campaign finance data](https://www.fec.gov/data/). Nevertheless, navigating through the website might be complicated.
Our goal is to provide an easy way to explore the dataset by providing the user with some intuitive summary statistics presented in the form of tables and plots.
We will focus on contributions directed towards candidates running for Senate seats in the 2018 election.
Some questions we will be able to answr with this app:

* What is the average contribution an individual makes at a certain moment of the campaign?
* How much money have the candidates raised?
* Where is the comey coming from?
* What types of workers are contributing the most?

### Usage

* Navigate to the "Analyze" tab.
* Users will first choose a State that they want to analyze from the left panel.
* Next, a list for the corresponding Democrat and Republican candidates will appear. Candidates apperaring at the top of the list are the ones that received more donations overall.
* Finally, the timeframe can be narrowed down to focus on a specific period.

### Outcomes

* Table showing number of donations, total amount and average donation.
* Average daily donations plot. A slider allows to adjust the scale of the y-axis.
* Cumulative daily donations plot. A slider allows to adjust the scale of the y-axis.
* Bar plot showing individual donations by city of origin. A slider allows to adjust the number of cities displayed.
* Stacked bar plot showing the shares of the top individual donations by contributor occupation. A slider allows to adjust the number of occupations displayed.
