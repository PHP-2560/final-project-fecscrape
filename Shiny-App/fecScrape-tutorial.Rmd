# fecScrape

The fecScrape package provides functions to interface with the [OpenFEC API](https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/). OpenFEC API allows you to access funding data on candidates and committees. This package allows users to scrape individual- and aggregated-level donation data, plot these data to examine the timecourse of donation as well as geographic spread of donations, and does some basic summary statistics.
